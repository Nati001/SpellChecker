In deeling with students on the hih school level that is the second third and forth year of high school 
we must bare in mind that to some degree they are at a dificult sychological stage generaly called adolesence 
Students at this level are likely to be confused mentaly to be subject to involuntery distractions and romantic dreamines
 They are basicaly timid or self consious they lack frankness and are usualy very sensitive but hate to admit it 
 They are motivated iether by great ambition probably out of all proportion to their capabiltys
 or by extreme lazines caused by the fear of not suceeding or ataining their objectives
